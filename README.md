# Equipment Simulator for Lords Mobile
Equipment Simulator for Lord's Mobile is a passion project intended to help friends and teammates learn all aspects of the game, and aid in decision making when comparing in-game sets. It is a full stack web application with an Angular front-end, Express.js back-end, and MongoDB database. It is a passion project with no commercial application that is strictly to help the community. I do not own any asssets. All stock photos are under the CC license and Google Material Icons are under Apache 2.0 license. 

This is version 2 of the project that is currently being developed. This project will be updated with additional guides, builds, and UI design as the content in the game changes
